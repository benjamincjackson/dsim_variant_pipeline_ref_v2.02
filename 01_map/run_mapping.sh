# Map each Dsim fastq file to the v2.02 reference sequence

## For Jose's data:
# SM can come straight from the sample file table downloaded from ENA
# There is one library per sample, so library ID can just be set to the sample ID
# PL is 'ILLUMINA'
# ID can be the EBI accession ('ERR...') (MD225 is the only sample with > 1 sequencing run)
##
# This seems to be the same as the Andofatto data - the methods in Rogers et al suggest one 
# library per lane
