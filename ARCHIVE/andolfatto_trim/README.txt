Trim fastq files for the two samples that I trimmed in the GBE paper (MD233
and MD15) with the minimum average base quality score threshold set to 20

These two samples are from Andolfatto's data, and correspond to ENA sample
names as follows (you can grep them out of the EBI sample table):

MD233 = SAMN02691687, FASTQ file name includes: SRR1943276
MD15 = SAMN02691675, FASTQ file name includes: SRR1943291
